# Python-based packages
- [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/) is a cross-platform Python library for differentiable programming of quantum computers. Train a quantum computer the same way as a neural network.
- [PyQuil](https://github.com/rigetti/pyquil) is a Python library for quantum programming using Quil, the quantum instruction language developed at Rigetti Computing. 
- [QuTiP](https://github.com/qutip/qutip) is open-source software for simulating the dynamics of closed and open quantum systems. QuTiP aims to provide user-friendly and efficient numerical simulations of a wide variety of quantum mechanical problems, including those with Hamiltonians and/or collapse operators with arbitrary time-dependence, commonly found in a wide range of physics applications.
- [TensoFlow Quantum](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/03/announcing-tensorflow-quantum-open.html) TFQ is an open-source library for the rapid prototyping of quantum ML models. TFQ provides the tools necessary for bringing the quantum computing and machine learning research communities together to control and model natural or artificial quantum systems; e.g. Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) processors with ~50-100 qubits. 
- [Q-CTRL](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/) The Q-CTRL solution is called BOULDER OPAL. This Python package is open source. Boulder Opal is a versatile toolkit that provides everything you need to improve and automate the performance of quantum hardware. The core capabilities of Boulder Opal fall under the framework of quantum control—the discipline that addresses the question, “How can systems that obey the laws of quantum mechanics be efficiently manipulated to create desired behaviors?”
- [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) is a Python software library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum circuits, and then running them on quantum computers and quantum simulators.  
- [qcware](https://qcware.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/quickstart.html) Forge is a service that lets you develop and run quantum software.
- [qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) Qiskit is open-source software for working with quantum computers at the level of circuits, pulses, and algorithms. The central goal of Qiskit is to build a software stack that makes it easy for anyone to use quantum computers, regardless of their skill level or area of interest; Qiskit allows one to easily design experiments and applications and run them on real quantum computers and/or classical simulators.
